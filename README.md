# Netflix-clone

For my project, I’ve created a Netflix clone using HTML and CSS to replicate the sleek and modern user interface of the popular streaming service. This project demonstrates my ability to design responsive and visually appealing web pages by incorporating elements such as a dynamic header, content carousels, and grid layouts. By focusing on clean design and intuitive navigation, I’ve aimed to capture the essence of Netflix’s user experience while showcasing my skills in front-end development.
